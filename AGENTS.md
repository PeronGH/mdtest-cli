# Repository Guidelines

This repository is for `mdtest`, a test runner that uses AI agents as interpreters for Markdown test cases. The project dogfoods itself — mdtest's own integration tests are `.test.md` files run by mdtest.

## Workflow

**Order of operations**

1. **Spec first**: update or add spec before changing production code.
2. **Tests next**: add/adjust `.test.md` files that encode the spec.
3. **Code last**: implement the spec fully.

**Drift rule**

- If implementation or tests reveal a missing/incorrect requirement, **update the spec first**.
- If code behavior changes, **spec must reflect it** before merge.

## Directory Structure

- `/docs/design/` — Design-level specs. Numbered starting from `001`. Describes what the system should do and why, in terms that anyone technical can follow without reading the codebase. Covers behavior, user-facing concepts, and architectural decisions.
- `/docs/implementation/` — Implementation-level specs. Numbered starting from `001`. Written for programmers and coding agents. Describes interfaces, constraints, invariants, and structural decisions. Should be declarative and durable — express intent and rationale, not one-time plans tied to specific lines of code.

**Referencing rules**: Design docs may reference other design docs. Implementation docs may reference design docs and other implementation docs. Design docs must not reference implementation docs — the dependency flows downward only.

- `/tests/` — Test cases as `.test.md` files. This is what mdtest runs.

## Tests

Test files end with `.test.md`. They are plain Markdown with optional YAML front matter for execution metadata:

```yaml
---
requires: [mcp:browser]
side-effects: true
---
```

No front matter means no requirements, runs everywhere.

A bootstrap layer of Go unit tests covers core runner logic (front matter parsing, capability matching, prompt construction). Integration and end-to-end flows are `.test.md` files.
